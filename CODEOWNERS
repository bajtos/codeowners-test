# The list in this file serves two purposes:
# 1. It keeps track of Functional Area Owners, allowing all participants
#    to find which people to ping depending on the functional area involved.
# 2. It tells GitHub which maintainers to automatically assign for code reviews
#    of incoming pull requests.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners,
# the last matching pattern has the most precedence.
#
# See https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Because the last matching pattern takes the most precedence, we need to list
# the functional areas from most generic (e.g. Models & Repositories) to most
# narrow (e.g. MongoDB).

# To keep things simple, we assign documentation to all core team members
# For longer term, we may want to re-organize doc files around functional
# areas (create a new subdirectory for each functional area), so that
# we can assign more specific code owners to different doc pages.
